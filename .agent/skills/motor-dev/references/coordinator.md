# Coordinator Module — Architecture & Implementation

## Multi-Process Architecture

The Coordinator is the **inference scheduling gateway** — it exposes an OpenAI- and Anthropic-compatible API, schedules requests across engine instances, and runs as a **multi-process system** with ZMQ-based IPC and POSIX shared memory for workload data.

``` text

│
├── SchedulerServer (1 process)           — ZMQ ROUTER, single source of truth
│     owns: InstanceManager (master copy), WorkloadSharedMemoryWriter
│     start order: 1st | stop order: last
│
├── MgmtServer (1 process)               — Management API
│     owns: InstanceManager (mirror), orphan detection (ppid check + role shm)
│     start order: 2nd (2s sleep after Scheduler for ZMQ socket binding)
│
├── ObsServer (1 process)                — Observability API
│     owns: MetricsCollector, _SchedulerInstanceProvider (via SchedulerConnectionManager)
│     start order: 3rd
│
└── InferenceWorkers (N processes)        — OpenAI- & Anthropic-compatible API
      owns: RequestManager, SchedulerClient (ZMQ DEALER), WorkloadSharedMemoryReader
      start order: last | shared socket via SO_REUSEPORT
```

**Why spawn (not fork):** `multiprocessing.get_context("spawn")` starts each process from a clean Python interpreter. This avoids inherited file descriptors, lock states, and CUDA/NPU context corruption that plague `fork`.

**Process lifecycle:**

- Start order: Scheduler (bind ZMQ first) → Mgmt (connect ZMQ) → Obs → Inference
- Stop order: Inference → Obs → Mgmt → Scheduler (reverse, via `STOP_ORDER` constant)
- Termination: `terminate()` → `join(timeout=10s)` → `kill()` (three-stage, graceful first)
- Health supervision: `SubprocessSupervisor` monitors child PIDs, auto-restarts dead processes

### HA: Master/Standby

- `StandbyManager` controls which node is master via external coordination (e.g., etcd lease)
- `RoleShmHolder` creates `coordinator_standby_role` shared memory (9 bytes: 1B role + 8B heartbeat ns)
- Daemon writes heartbeat every `ROLE_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_SEC` (2s); Mgmt process checks staleness (>5s = unhealthy)
- **Only InferenceWorkers are started on master** — Scheduler, Mgmt, and Obs all run on both master and standby. The daemon unconditionally starts SCHEDULER/MGMT/OBS (`_start_processes([SCHEDULER, MGMT, OBS])`); only Inference is gated by role (standby keeps it stopped for instance sync readiness).
- On role change: `on_become_master` starts Inference workers; `on_become_standby` stops them

## IPC: ZMQ Protocol + Shared Memory

### ZMQ (Scheduler ↔ Mgmt/Workers)

**Transport:** `zmq.asyncio` ROUTER/DEALER over Unix IPC sockets (`ipc:///tmp/scheduler_frontend`)

**Serialization:** `msgspec.msgpack` (not pickle) with zero-copy optimization — payloads >1024 bytes go in separate ZMQ frames to avoid msgpack decoding overhead on the receiver side.

**Request types** (defined in `zmq_protocol.py: SchedulerRequestType`):

| Request | Direction | Purpose |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| `ALLOCATE_ONLY` | Worker → Scheduler | Worker selects locally; Scheduler only allocates the workload. Worker submits its candidate list + affinity candidates; server does the authoritative selection |
| `UPDATE_WORKLOAD` | Worker → Scheduler | Worker reports current workload (active tokens, KV cache) |
| `GET_AVAILABLE_INSTANCES` | Worker → Scheduler | Worker fetches current instance list and workload SHM name |
| `REFRESH_INSTANCES` | Mgmt → Scheduler | Mgmt pushes batch instance changes from Controller |
| `CONFIRM_SAMPLE` | Worker → Scheduler | Cross-worker precision-sampling exit gate |
| `RECORD_PRECISION_RESULT` | Worker → Scheduler | Records global consecutive failures + probing state |
| `FINISH_PRECISION_ACTION` | Worker → Scheduler | Clears probing after a probe/alarm cycle |
| `DISMISS_PRECISION_ALARM_STATE` | Worker → Scheduler | External recovery cleared the alarm |
| `CIRCUIT_BREAKER_REPORT` | Worker → Scheduler | Worker reports instance failure/success to the circuit breaker |

**Instance change broadcast:**

- Scheduler publishes multipart `[INSTANCE_CHANGE_TOPIC, version_bytes]` via ZMQ PUB socket
- For ADD/DEL events an extra msgpack frame carries an incremental **delta** of the instance list change; workers patch their cache with it. SET (full-replace) events skip the delta.
- Each worker subscribes to the PUB socket; on notification, invalidates or patches its cached instance list
- Workers also detect `instance_version` bumps in the workload SHM header as a backup signal
- Circuit-breaker state changes are published on `CIRCUIT_BREAKER_TOPIC` (multipart `[topic, msgpack_payload]`)

### Workload Shared Memory

**Purpose:** Workers need per-endpoint workload data (active tokens, KV cache usage) on every scheduling decision. A ZMQ round-trip per request would add unacceptable latency.

**Design:** Scheduler writes to SHM; all workers read directly via `multiprocessing.shared_memory.SharedMemory`.

**Layout** (`workload_shm/layout.py`):

``` text
Offset  Size   Field
0       4B     magic              = 0x574B4C44 ("WKLD")
4       2B     schema_version     — SCHEMA_VERSION=3 (layout compatibility)
6       2B     (padding)
8       8B     sequence           — seqlock write counter, bumped on every write
16      4B     entry_count        — number of valid entries
20      4B     max_entries        — slot capacity (default 10240)
24      8B     instance_version   — bumped on REFRESH_INSTANCES (instance set change)
32      8B     heartbeat_sequence — Scheduler bumps ~1s
40      8B     prefill_sequence   — per-role workload change counter
48      8B     decode_sequence    — per-role workload change counter
56      8B     hybrid_sequence    — per-role workload change counter
64      N×24B  entries            — per-endpoint workload slots (max 10240)
```

Header is 64B, each entry 24B (`instance_id 4B, endpoint_id 4B, role 1B, padding 3B, active_tokens 8B, prefill_cost 4B float32`). `prefill_cost` is stamped by SMetric / KV affinity after allocate and released with tokens; RR/LB leave it 0. `sequence` follows seqlock semantics: odd = writer in progress, even = readers may accept the snapshot after a matching second header read. Readers additionally verify the three per-role sequences are unchanged across the read for consistency.

**SHM name:** `mindie_workload_<scheduler_pid>` — includes PID for uniqueness and orphan detection.

**Recovery:** On startup, if SHM name exists (`FileExistsError`), the old segment is unlinked (stale from prior crash/kill) and recreated. Workers detect stale SHM (heartbeat >5s old) → trigger full refresh.

### Role Shared Memory (HA)

``` yaml
Name: coordinator_standby_role
Size: 9 bytes
  [0]:     role byte (ROLE_SHM_MASTER=1 / ROLE_SHM_STANDBY=0)
  [1..8]:  heartbeat timestamp (nanoseconds, 8B unsigned)
```

Role byte is 0 (standby/unknown) by default; the daemon writes 1 only after acquiring the master lock (e.g., etcd lease). Initial role is always standby when master/standby is enabled, so Mgmt does not report master before the lock is acquired.

Mgmt process checks this SHM for liveness probe: `getppid() != daemon_pid OR role_shm_heartbeat stale >5s → unhealthy`.

## Scheduling & Routing

### Scheduling Policies (pluggable)

Located in `scheduler/policy/`, each policy implements `BaseSchedulingPolicy`:

| Policy | Algorithm | When to Use |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| `RoundRobinPolicy` | Simple atomic counter, mod endpoint count | Uniform workload, no KV cache locality |
| `LoadBalancePolicy` | Reads workload SHM, picks endpoint with minimum active tokens | Heterogeneous workloads, varying request lengths |
| `KvCacheAffinityPolicy` | Queries KV Conductor (via `ConductorApiClient`) for prefix match; prefers endpoints with cached blocks | High prefix reuse, PD disaggregation |
| `SMetricPolicy` | Queries Conductor; ranks P/U by remaining prefill `max(0, isl - matched)`. Decode falls back to load-balance. Central Scheduler hybrid-gates min-cost vs min ledger `prefill_cost`. | Compare / steer by remaining prefill only (`scheduler_type=smetric`) |

**Conductor `/query` wire encoding** (`ConductorApiClient.query_conductor`):
`kv_conductor_config.query_encoding` (default `"msgpack"`) selects the wire
format. MessagePack requests are sent via `SafeHTTPSClient.post_bytes()`
(msgspec-encoded, `Content-Type: application/msgpack`) and responses are
decoded by Content-Type (msgpack via `msgspec`, otherwise JSON — legacy
JSON-only conductors keep working). Set `query_encoding: "json"` for older
kv-conductor binaries.<br>

**Factory registration** (`factory.py`): `SchedulingPolicyFactory` maps policy name → class. New policies register here.

The policy is selected by `SchedulerType` (`config/coordinator.py`): `LOAD_BALANCE` (default) / `ROUND_ROBIN` / `KV_CACHE_AFFINITY` / `SMETRIC`. For `scheduler_type=kv_cache_affinity`, a sub-mode is chosen by `kv_affinity.mode`:

- `unified` (default) — single score fusing affinity and live load; pick the minimum
- `load_gated` — keep the N least-loaded endpoints, then pick the longest cached prefix

Tunables live under `CoordinatorConfig.scheduler_config.kv_affinity`: `mode`, `load_weight`, `overlap_credit`, `prefill_load_scale`, `load_gate_topn`, `w_npu`, `w_cpu`, `w_disk`.

After a real `/query` (prompts shorter than one `block_size` skip the HTTP call), both `KvCacheAffinityPolicy` and `SMetricPolicy` log `smetric: req_id=... isl=... conductor_rsp=...` (`isl` = prompt token count). Pair with EngineServer `vllm_cache_hit:` on the same `req_id`.

### Router Strategies (dynamic, by live topology)

There is **no DeployMode → router class map**. `select_router_class()` (`router/dispatch.py`) decides the router per request from the live instance topology (roles currently online + dispatch compatibility):

``` text
P and D roles both online AND a compatible dispatch pair exists
  (both roles have non-blocked instances)          → UnifiedPDRouter
otherwise, degrade (fallback to hybrid enabled or
  hybrid deployment) with any unblocked P/U instance → PDHybridRouter
no routable topology at all                         → HTTP 503
```

- `UnifiedPDRouter` (strategies/unified_pd.py): routes to P/D pairs sharing a dispatch capability (e.g., common kv_connector or explicit `dispatch_profile`).
- `PDHybridRouter` (strategies/pd_hybrid.py): single instance runs prefill+decode together; also the degradation target when PD separation is unavailable (e.g., P/D instances circuit-broken or advertising no shared dispatch).
- Both subclass `BaseRouter` (strategies/base.py); `_is_pd_hybrid_deploy` / `_is_pd_separation_fallback_to_hybrid_enabled` gates fallback (config `scheduler_config.enable_pd_separation_fallback_to_hybrid`, default true).

**Request lifecycle:**

1. `prepare_resource(plan)` — scheduling policy selects best instance → allocates workload slot
2. `forward_request(plan)` — HTTP POST to engine's infer endpoint (streaming or non-streaming)
3. `release_all(plan)` — sends `UPDATE_WORKLOAD` via ZMQ DEALER to Scheduler

### Hot-Reload

Hot-reload is driven by a `ConfigWatcher` in the **Mgmt process** (not the daemon's loop): when the config file changes, it calls `CoordinatorConfig.reload()` (re-parse from JSON) and pushes the updated config into the running `ManagementServer`. The reload skip-set is exactly `frozenset({"worker_index", "worker_metaserver_port"})` — runtime-only fields that must not change mid-flight; everything else re-applies. If no valid config path exists, hot-reload is disabled.

## Event Flow: Controller → Mgmt → Scheduler → Workers

``` text
Controller detects instance change
  → POST /instances/refresh (InsEventMsg: ADD/DEL/SET + instance list)
    → Mgmt receives, updates local InstanceManager mirror
      → ZMQ REFRESH_INSTANCES to Scheduler
        → Scheduler updates master InstanceManager, bumps version
          → PUB socket: INSTANCE_CHANGE_TOPIC notification (+ delta frame for ADD/DEL)
          → Workload SHM: instance_version bump in header
            → Workers: patch/invalidate caches, re-fetch on next scheduling call
```

## Fault Tolerance: Circuit Breaker & Precision Detection

**Circuit breaker** (`domain/circuit_breaker.py`): per-instance state machine tracking consecutive failures. Each instance is `"closed"` (normal, schedulable) or `"open"` (tripped, blocked from scheduling). Workers report instance outcomes via `CIRCUIT_BREAKER_REPORT`; the Scheduler's `CircuitBreakerManager` trips the circuit after three consecutive failures (30s first trip timeout, with backoff) and resets the failure count on success or auto-recovery. State changes are broadcast to workers on `CIRCUIT_BREAKER_TOPIC` (msgpack payload). `select_router_class()` consults the breaker: a P/D pair is only "compatible" if both roles have non-blocked instances, and 503 is returned when all instances are circuit-broken.

**Precision detection** (`fault_tolerance/precision/` + `fault_tolerance/probe/`): cross-worker sampling (`sample_controller.py`, `streak_result.py`) coordinated with the Scheduler via the four precision request types — `CONFIRM_SAMPLE` (cross-worker exit gate), `RECORD_PRECISION_RESULT` (global consecutive failures + probing state), `FINISH_PRECISION_ACTION` (clear probing after probe/alarm), `DISMISS_PRECISION_ALARM_STATE` (external recovery cleared the alarm). Alarm publishing lives in `fault_tolerance/alarm/` (`precision_alarm.py`); probes (`chat_probe.py`, `router_probe.py`) route identically to user traffic through `select_router_class()`.

## Development Rules

- **New scheduling policies**: subclass `BaseSchedulingPolicy`, implement `select_instance()`, register in `factory.py`.
- **New router strategies**: subclass `BaseRouter`, implement `prepare_resource`/`forward_request`/`release_all`, place in `router/strategies/`, and wire the class into `select_router_class()` in `dispatch.py` (there is no static router map).
- **New ZMQ request types**: add to `SchedulerRequestType` enum in `zmq_protocol.py`; add handler method in `scheduler_server.py`; add client method in `scheduler_client.py`.
- **New process types**: subclass `BaseProcessManager`, implement `start()`/`stop()`/`health_check()`; add key to `PROCESS_KEY_*` constants; add to start/stop order in `process/constants.py`.
- **Observability endpoints**: `/metrics` is served by ObsServer (port `coordinator_obs_port`, default 1027), NOT MgmtServer. Controller and ccae_reporter connect to the obs port.
- **HA**: StandbyManager is shm-agnostic — role byte is written by Daemon's `on_role_changed` callback, not by StandbyManager itself.
