"""Per-DP request-count and active_tokens statistics for the coordinator.

Counts successfully committed ALLOCATE_ONLY requests per
``(instance_id, dp_rank)`` with ``collections.Counter``.  Emission is driven
by the scheduler client's ``window_sec`` timer (worker 0): each tick
snapshots schema-5 SHM ``active_tokens`` and prints them together with the
request counts accumulated since the previous tick.  Idle DPs with both
``requests == 0`` and ``active_tokens == 0`` are omitted.  ``record()``
never logs by itself.  ``window_sec <= 0`` disables emission.

The window comes from ``scheduler_config.dp_stats_window``
(independent of the kv-affinity stats window), so per-DP stats are
emitted in every deployment and policy.
