# Coordinator Module — Architecture & Implementation

## Multi-Process Architecture

The Coordinator is the **inference scheduling gateway** — it exposes an OpenAI- and Anthropic-compatible API, schedules requests across engine instances, and runs as a **multi-process system** with ZMQ-based IPC and POSIX shared memory for workload data.

``` text
CoordinatorDaemon (parent process, async main loop)
│
├── SchedulerServer (1 process)           — ZMQ ROUTER, single source of truth
│     owns: InstanceManager (master copy), WorkloadSharedMemoryWriter
│     start order: 1st | stop order: last
│
├── MgmtServer (1 process)               — Management API
│     owns: InstanceManager (mirror), orphan detection (ppid check + role shm)
│     start order: 2nd (2s sleep after Scheduler for ZMQ socket binding)
│
├── ObsServer (1 process)                — Observability API
│     owns: MetricsCollector, _SchedulerInstanceProvider (via SchedulerConnectionManager)
│     start order: 3rd

└── InferenceWorkers (N processes)        — OpenAI- & Anthropic-compatible API

```

**Why spawn (not fork):** `multiprocessing.get_context("spawn")` starts each process from a clean Python interpreter. This avoids inherited file descriptors, lock states, and CUDA/NPU context corruption that plague `fork`.

**Process lifecycle:**

- Start order: Scheduler (bind ZMQ first) → Mgmt (connect ZMQ) → Obs → Inference
- Stop order: Inference → Obs → Mgmt → Scheduler (reverse, via `STOP_ORDER` constant)
- Termination: `terminate()` → `join(timeout=10s)` → `kill()` (three-stage, graceful first)
- Health supervision: `SubprocessSupervisor` monitors child PIDs, auto-restarts dead processes

### HA: Master/Standby

- `StandbyManager` controls which node is master via external coordination (e.g., etcd lease)
- `RoleShmHolder` creates `coordinator_standby_role` shared memory (9 bytes: 1B role + 8B heartbeat ns)
- Daemon writes heartbeat every `ROLE_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_SEC` (2s); Mgmt process checks staleness (>5s = unhealthy)
- **Only InferenceWorkers are started on master** — Scheduler, Mgmt, and Obs all run on both master and standby. The daemon unconditionally starts SCHEDULER/MGMT/OBS (`_start_processes([SCHEDULER, MGMT, OBS])`); only Inference is gated by role (standby keeps it stopped for instance sync readiness).
- On role change: `on_become_master` starts Inference workers; `on_become_standby` stops them

## IPC: ZMQ Protocol + Shared Memory

### ZMQ (Scheduler ↔ Mgmt/Workers)

**Transport:** `zmq.asyncio` ROUTER/DEALER over Unix IPC sockets (`ipc:///tmp/scheduler_frontend`)

**Serialization:** `msgspec.msgpack` (not pickle) with zero-copy optimization — payloads >1024 bytes go in separate ZMQ frames to avoid msgpack decoding overhead on the receiver side.

**Request types** (defined in `zmq_protocol.py: SchedulerRequestType`):

| Request | Direction | Purpose |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| `ALLOCATE_ONLY` | Worker → Scheduler | Worker selects locally; Scheduler only allocates the workload. Worker submits its candidate list + affinity candidates; server does the authoritative selection |
| `UPDATE_WORKLOAD` | Worker → Scheduler | Worker reports current workload (active tokens, KV cache) |
| `GET_AVAILABLE_INSTANCES` | Worker → Scheduler | Worker fetches current instance list and workload SHM name |
| `REFRESH_INSTANCES` | Mgmt → Scheduler | Mgmt pushes batch instance changes from Controller |
| `CONFIRM_SAMPLE` | Worker → Scheduler | Cross-worker precision-sampling exit gate |
| `RECORD_PRECISION_RESULT` | Worker → Scheduler | Records global consecutive failures + probing state |
| `FINISH_PRECISION_ACTION` | Worker → Scheduler | Clears probing after a probe/alarm cycle |
| `DISMISS_PRECISION_ALARM_STATE` | Worker → Scheduler | External recovery cleared the alarm |
| `CIRCUIT_BREAKER_REPORT` | Worker → Scheduler | Worker reports instance failure/success to the circuit breaker |

**Instance change broadcast:**

- Scheduler publishes multipart `[INSTANCE_CHANGE_TOPIC, version_bytes]` via ZMQ PUB socket
- For ADD/DEL events an extra msgpack frame carries an incremental **delta** of the instance list change; workers patch their cache with it. SET (full-replace) events skip the delta.
- Each worker subscribes to the PUB socket; on notification, invalidates or patches its cached instance list
- Workers also detect `instance_version` bumps in the workload SHM header as a backup signal
- Circuit-breaker state changes are published on `CIRCUIT_BREAKER_TOPIC` (multipart `[topic, msgpack_payload]`)

### Workload Shared Memory

**Purpose:** Workers need per-endpoint workload data (active tokens, KV cache usage) on every scheduling decision. A ZMQ round-trip per request would add unacceptable latency.

**Design:** Scheduler writes to SHM; all workers read directly via `multiprocessing.shared_memory.SharedMemory`.

**Layout** (`workload_shm/layout.py`):

``` text
Offset  Size   Field
0       4B     magic              = 0x574B4C44 ("WKLD")
4       2B     schema_version     — fixed SCHEMA_VERSION=4 (layout compatibility)
6       2B     (padding)
8       8B     sequence           — seqlock write counter, bumped on every write
16      4B     entry_count        — number of valid entries
20      4B     max_entries        — slot capacity (default 10240)
24      8B     instance_version   — bumped on REFRESH_INSTANCES (instance set change)
32      8B     heartbeat_sequence — Scheduler bumps ~1/s
40      8B     prefill_sequence   — per-role workload change counter
48      8B     decode_sequence    — per-role workload change counter
56      8B     hybrid_sequence    — per-role workload change counter
64      N×24B  entries            — per-endpoint workload slots (max 10240)
```

Header is 64B, each entry is 24B (`instance_id 4B, endpoint_id 4B, role 1B, padding 3B, active_tokens 8B, prefill_cost 4B`), and entries start at offset 64. Instance and endpoint IDs are signed 32-bit integers. `sequence` follows seqlock semantics: odd = writer in progress, even = readers may accept the snapshot after a matching second header read. Readers additionally verify the three per-role sequences are unchanged across the read for consistency.

**SHM name:** `mindie_workload_<scheduler_pid>` — includes PID for uniqueness and orphan detection.

**Recovery:** On startup, if SHM name exists (`FileExistsError`), the old segment is unlinked (stale from prior crash/kill) and recreated. Workers detect stale SHM (heartbeat >5s old) → trigger full refresh.

### Role Shared Memory (HA)

``` yaml
Name: coordinator_standby_role
Size: 9 bytes
  [0]:     role byte (ROLE_SHM_MASTER=1 / ROLE_SHM_STANDBY=0)
  [1..8]:  heartbeat timestamp (nanoseconds, 8B unsigned)
```

Role byte is 0 (standby/unknown) by default; the daemon writes 1 only after acquiring the master lock (e.g., etcd lease). Initial role is always standby when master/standby is enabled, so Mgmt does not report master before the lock is acquired.

Mgmt process checks this SHM for liveness probe: `getppid() != daemon_pid OR role_shm_heartbeat stale >5s → unhealthy`.

## Scheduling & Routing

### Scheduling Policies (pluggable)

Located in `scheduler/policy/`, each policy implements `BaseSchedulingPolicy`:

| Policy | Algorithm | When to Use |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| `RoundRobinPolicy` | Simple atomic counter, mod endpoint count | Uniform workload, no KV cache locality |
| `LoadBalancePolicy` | Reads workload SHM, picks endpoint with minimum active tokens | Heterogeneous workloads, varying request lengths |
| `KvCacheAffinityPolicy` | Queries KV Conductor (via `ConductorApiClient`) for prefix match; prefers endpoints with cached blocks | High prefix reuse, PD disaggregation |
| `SMetricPolicy` | Queries KV Conductor and ranks by remaining prefill cost; the central Scheduler gates request-cost ranking against its shared running average and the scored endpoints' ledgers | Prefill routing driven by uncached prompt cost |

SMetric does not import or invoke another policy. Tokenization lives in the policy-neutral
`scheduler/tokenizer.py`; load-balance fallback is owned by the scheduler/client orchestrators.

**Conductor `/query` wire encoding** (`ConductorApiClient.query_conductor`):
`kv_conductor_config.query_encoding` (default `"msgpack"`) selects the wire
format. MessagePack requests are sent via `SafeHTTPSClient.post_bytes()`
(msgspec-encoded, `Content-Type: application/msgpack`) and responses are
decoded by Content-Type (msgpack via `msgspec`, otherwise JSON — legacy
JSON-only conductors keep working). Set `query_encoding: "json"` for older
kv-conductor binaries.<br>

**Factory registration** (`factory.py`): `SchedulingPolicyFactory` maps policy name → class. New policies register here.

The policy is selected by `SchedulerType` (`config/coordinator.py`): `LOAD_BALANCE` / `ROUND_ROBIN` / `KV_CACHE_AFFINITY` (default) / `SMETRIC`. For `scheduler_type=kv_cache_affinity`, a sub-mode is chosen by `kv_affinity.mode`:

- `unified` (default) — single score fusing affinity and live load; pick the minimum
- `load_gated` — keep the N least-loaded endpoints, then pick the longest cached prefix

Tunables live under `CoordinatorConfig.scheduler_config.kv_affinity`: `mode`, `load_weight`, `overlap_credit`, `prefill_load_scale`, `load_gate_topn`, `w_npu`, `w_cpu`, `w_disk`.

### Router Strategies (dynamic, by live topology)

There is **no DeployMode → router class map**. `select_router_class()` (`router/dispatch.py`) decides the router per request from the live instance topology (roles currently online + dispatch compatibility):

``` text
P and D roles both online AND a compatible dispatch pair exists
  (both roles have non-blocked instances)          → UnifiedPDRouter
otherwise, degrade (fallback to hybrid enabled or
  hybrid deployment) with any unblocked P/U instance → PDHybridRouter
no routable topology at all                         → HTTP 503
```

- `UnifiedPDRouter` (strategies/unified_pd.py): routes to P/D pairs sharing a dispatch capability (e.g., common kv_connector or explicit `dispatch_profile`).
- `PDHybridRouter` (strategies/pd_hybrid.py): single instance runs prefill+decode together; also the degradation target when PD separation is unavailable (e.g., P/D instances circuit-broken or advertising no shared dispatch).
- Both subclass `BaseRouter` (strategies/base.py); `_is_pd_hybrid_deploy` / `_is_pd_separation_fallback_to_hybrid_enabled` gates fallback (config `scheduler_config.enable_pd_separation_fallback_to_hybrid`, default true).

**vLLM P/D coordination modes** (`UnifiedPDRouter`):

| Instance `dispatch_capabilities` | Mode | Order |
|---|---|---|
| homogeneous `prefill_handoff_decode` | HANDOFF | allocate P → prefill → allocate D → decode |
| homogeneous `concurrent_engine_sync` (vLLM layerwise / `dispatch_profile=trigger`) | TRIGGER | allocate D first → decode with `do_remote_prefill` + `metaserver` → D POSTs Worker `/v1/metaserver` → same Worker allocates P and forwards prefill |
| mixed handoff + trigger in one cluster | — | HTTP 503 |

Mode selection uses allocated-instance `dispatch_capabilities` **and** cluster detection from the Worker-local instance cache (`get_local_instances`). That cache already holds `dispatch_capabilities`; SHM only has workload numbers. `GET_AVAILABLE_INSTANCES` remains a force-refresh RPC and must not run on every request. `ALLOCATE_ONLY` responses go through `_serialize_instance_minimal`, which must keep `dispatch_capabilities` (not only `id/role/job_name/model_name/engine_type`); otherwise Worker rebuilds empty caps and falls back to adapter HANDOFF while still allocating Decode first. If the selected mode is TRIGGER but the attempt has no decode resource (handoff-style P-first / D-deferred), fail closed with HTTP 503 — do not return TRIGGER and then `RuntimeError` into retry→500.

SGLang stays on native bootstrap (`CoordinationMode.BOOTSTRAP`); that path is unchanged.

**Trigger metaserver (per Worker, not on the infer port):**

- `RequestInfo` is process-local. Infer workers share `coordinator_api_infer_port` via `SO_REUSEPORT`, so Decode's metaserver callback cannot land on the infer socket.
- `inference_workers_config.worker_metaserver_base_port` default **12000**. Worker `i` listens on `base+i`; set to `0` to disable.
- Dedicated uvicorn app (`InferenceServer.create_metaserver_app()`) exposes only `POST /v1/metaserver` — no API key, no infer TLS (`lifespan=off`). Default API-key / rate-limit skip sets include `/v1/metaserver`. Decode engine callbacks have no API key; do not require one on this socket. Infer is the primary uvicorn; metaserver is a sidecar. Bind/init/`serve()` failure logs ERROR, clears this process's `worker_metaserver_port`, and leaves the infer port running. Trigger requests then 503 via `_ensure_trigger_metaserver`. Infer exit sets `should_exit` and cancels the sidecar.
- The metaserver listen host prefers `POD_IP` when set, otherwise `api_config.coordinator_api_host` (same fallback as the advertised callback URL). Do not bind loopback: Decode may run on another node. Infer uvicorn still listens on `coordinator_api_host`.
- The callback URL advertises `POD_IP` when available, otherwise `api_config.coordinator_api_host`; IPv6 literals are RFC 3986 bracketed. `0.0.0.0`/`::` remain valid listen hosts at startup (including default `worker_metaserver_base_port=12000`). Trigger rejects them as advertised callback addresses when `POD_IP` is absent (HTTP 503 + error log), because wildcard listen addresses are not routable Decode callback destinations.
- Callback `request_id` is trimmed (`chatcmpl-` / `cmpl-…-0`) then looked up in that Worker's `RequestManager`. Query `?attempt=` must match the bound attempt (404 unknown request, 409 stale attempt).
- Each trigger attempt serializes callbacks with `AttemptContext.trigger_lock`. The active callback is registered as the attempt's Prefill task so disconnect/Decode failure during TTFT cancels it; a retry after Prefill completion returns idempotent success without allocating P again.
- If Scheduler allocation succeeds but Worker-local attempt workload registration fails, the allocation is rolled back directly with the returned workload delta.
- Runtime field `CoordinatorConfig.worker_metaserver_port` is per-process (`base+worker_index`) and is in the hot-reload skip-set.

**Request lifecycle:**

1. `prepare_resource(plan)` — scheduling policy selects best instance → allocates workload slot
2. `forward_request(plan)` — HTTP POST to engine's infer endpoint (streaming or non-streaming)
3. `release_all(plan)` — sends `UPDATE_WORKLOAD` via ZMQ DEALER to Scheduler

### Hot-Reload

Hot-reload is driven by a `ConfigWatcher` in the **Mgmt process** (not the daemon's loop): when the config file changes, it calls `CoordinatorConfig.reload()` (re-parse from JSON) and pushes the updated config into the running `ManagementServer`. The reload skip-set is exactly `frozenset({"worker_index"})` — the runtime-only field that must not change mid-flight; everything else re-applies. If no valid config path exists, hot-reload is disabled.

## Event Flow: Controller → Mgmt → Scheduler → Workers

``` text
Controller detects instance change
  → POST /instances/refresh (InsEventMsg: ADD/DEL/SET + instance list)
    → Mgmt rejects duplicate request IDs and pre-validates global ID ownership under its refresh lock
      → ZMQ REFRESH_INSTANCES to Scheduler
        → Scheduler updates master InstanceManager, bumps version
          → Mgmt updates its local InstanceManager mirror
            → PUB socket: INSTANCE_CHANGE_TOPIC notification (+ delta frame for ADD/DEL)
              → Workload SHM: instance_version bump in header
                → Workers: patch/invalidate caches, re-fetch on next scheduling call

Controller clears a handled precision alarm
  → POST /precision/alarm_cleared (clear scheduler precision-alarm state for a P/D group)
    → Mgmt sends DISMISS_PRECISION_ALARM_STATE to Scheduler
```

`InstanceManager` treats instance IDs as globally unique across all roles and the available, unavailable, and paused
pools. ADD is idempotent only when ID, role, job name, and endpoint structure match; otherwise it is a conflict. SET
rejects duplicate request IDs before building its ID-keyed diff while preserving same-ID structural updates. An
endpoint-based DEL validates the role plus the order-independent physical endpoint multiset (`ip`, business/bootstrap
ports, and `headless`) while ignoring order-derived endpoint IDs and endpoint map keys. An explicit ID-only DEL remains
available for administrative removal.

Standalone `motor.coordinator.register` IDs occupy signed-int32 range `0x40000000..0x7fffffff` and hash the role plus
the sorted complete endpoint group. The same normalization also determines job names and endpoint IDs, so CLI input
order does not change registration identity. This namespace separates them from ordinary low sequential Controller
IDs but does not make CRC32 collision-free. The CLI checks `GET /instances`, and the management server remains the
authoritative collision boundary. Endpoint-based deletion resolves the registered ID from `GET /instances` by role
plus an order-independent network endpoint signature instead of deleting a recomputed ID. ID-only deletion also
looks up the registered instance first and submits its actual role, job name, model name, and engine type.
Scheduler refresh acknowledgement is required before the Mgmt mirror is updated; a Scheduler rejection returns 503 and
leaves the mirror unchanged.

`motor.coordinator.domain` keeps its package-level compatibility exports (for example `InstanceReadiness` and
`RequestManager`) behind module `__getattr__` lazy loading. Domain submodules are imported directly by Coordinator models,
so `domain/__init__.py` must not eagerly import modules that depend on `models.request`; doing so creates a
`models.request → domain package → request_manager/scheduling → models.request` cycle in a fresh process.

### Management API Authentication

`mgmt_api_key_config.enable_api_key` enables a dedicated shared-secret boundary for privileged management APIs.
The secret is read from `api_key_file` and supplied in `X-Motor-Management-Key`. It protects `GET /instances`,
`POST /instances/refresh`, and `POST /precision/alarm_cleared`; `/startup`, `/liveness`, and `/readiness` remain
unauthenticated so Kubernetes probes continue to work. Controller and standalone `motor.coordinator.register` clients
load the same secret from a mounted/local file. This authentication is independent from inference `api_key_config`
and from `mgmt_tls_config`; use TLS as well when management traffic crosses an untrusted network.

## Fault Tolerance: Circuit Breaker & Precision Detection

**Circuit breaker** (`domain/circuit_breaker.py`): per-instance state machine tracking consecutive failures. Each instance is `"closed"` (normal, schedulable) or `"open"` (tripped, blocked from scheduling). Workers report instance outcomes via `CIRCUIT_BREAKER_REPORT`; the Scheduler's `CircuitBreakerManager` trips the circuit after three consecutive failures (30s first trip timeout, with backoff) and resets the failure count on success or auto-recovery. State changes are broadcast to workers on `CIRCUIT_BREAKER_TOPIC` (msgpack payload). `select_router_class()` consults the breaker: a P/D pair is only "compatible" if both roles have non-blocked instances, and 503 is returned when all instances are circuit-broken.

**Precision detection** (`fault_tolerance/precision/` + `fault_tolerance/probe/`): cross-worker sampling (`sample_controller.py`, `streak_result.py`) coordinated with the Scheduler via the four precision request types — `CONFIRM_SAMPLE` (cross-worker exit gate), `RECORD_PRECISION_RESULT` (global consecutive failures + probing state), `FINISH_PRECISION_ACTION` (clear probing after probe/alarm), `DISMISS_PRECISION_ALARM_STATE` (external recovery cleared the alarm). Alarm publishing lives in `fault_tolerance/alarm/` (`precision_alarm.py`); probes (`chat_probe.py`, `router_probe.py`) route identically to user traffic through `select_router_class()`.

## Development Rules

- **New scheduling policies**: subclass `BaseSchedulingPolicy`, implement `select_instance()`, register in `factory.py`.
- **New router strategies**: subclass `BaseRouter`, implement `prepare_resource`/`forward_request`/`release_all`, place in `router/strategies/`, and wire the class into `select_router_class()` in `dispatch.py` (there is no static router map).
- **New ZMQ request types**: add to `SchedulerRequestType` enum in `zmq_protocol.py`; add handler method in `scheduler_server.py`; add client method in `scheduler_client.py`.
- **New process types**: subclass `BaseProcessManager`, implement `start()`/`stop()`/`health_check()`; add key to `PROCESS_KEY_*` constants; add to start/stop order in `process/constants.py`.
- **Observability endpoints**: `/metrics` is served by ObsServer (port `coordinator_obs_port`, default 1027), NOT MgmtServer. Controller and ccae_reporter connect to the obs port.
- **HA**: StandbyManager is shm-agnostic — role byte is written by Daemon's `on_role_changed` callback, not by StandbyManager itself.
