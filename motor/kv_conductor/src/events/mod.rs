//! KV event types, deserialization, filtering, and application logic.
//!
//! Supports two event source formats:
//!
//! 1. **Pool backend** (Mooncake / Memcache / YuanRong): `PoolEvent` with
//!    `seq_hashes`/`block_hashes`, processed by `apply_pool_event`.  No
//!    `token_ids` on the wire — `tokens_hash` comes from the engine offload
//!    cache, retained content (TTL-bounded),
//!    or a prior lower-tier insert via the two-phase match (CPU→Disk
//!    promotion).
//!
//! 2. **vLLM engine** (native): `VllmEventMap` with `token_ids` + `block_size`,
//!    processed by `apply_vllm_event`.  `tokens_hash` is re-computed from
//!    `token_ids` via `compute_block_hash_for_seq` (XXH3, seed 1337); the
//!    engine's `block_hashes` are matched against `pending_pool` and cached
//!    as `SequenceBlockHash` until the pool confirms (reverse-lookup on
//!    `BlockRemoved` goes through `evict_pending_blocks`).
//!
//! ## Event filtering
//!
//! Events from non-main attention groups (SWA, Mamba, ChunkedLocal, etc.)
//! are filtered out.  Only `FullAttention`, `MlaAttention`, and
//! `SinkFullAttention` events are processed (PascalCase or snake_case wire
//! forms such as `mla_attention`); kinds like `sliding_window_mla` are
//! denied.  The allow/deny kind set is derived from NVIDIA Dynamo
//! kv-router (Apache-2.0); see `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`.  This ensures all
//! ingested events share the same `block_size`, avoiding multi-group hash
//! granularity mismatch.
